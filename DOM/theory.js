// DOM - Document Object Model

// The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. 

// DOM is nothing but tree like structure of HTML elements where all the elements are arranged in a hierarchical fashion.

// DOM enables javascript to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document while it is being viewed.


// DOM Selectors : 
// 1. getElementById() : It is used to select a single element based on its ID attribute.
// 2. getElementsByClassName() : It is used to select multiple elements based on their class attribute.
// 3. getElementsByTagName() : It is used to select multiple elements based on their tag name.
// 4. querySelector() : It is used to select the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.
// 5. querySelectorAll() : It is used to select all elements that match a specified CSS selector.
